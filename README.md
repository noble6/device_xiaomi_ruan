## Branches

- `axion`: AxionOS (LineageOS 23.2 based)
- `lunaris`: Lunaris AOSP 16.2
- `lineage-24.0`: LineageOS 24.0 (Android 17)
- `crdroid`: crDroid 17.0 (Android 17)

## Building

Put `manifest/ruan.xml` in `.repo/local_manifests/` and sync. Then apply
the patches in `patches/` to their projects:

```
for d in build/make frameworks/base frameworks/native vendor/lineage; do
  (cd $d && git am -3 $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/device/xiaomi/ruan/patches/$d/*.patch)
done
```

AxionOS:

```
. build/envsetup.sh
axion ruan user gms core
ax -br -j$(nproc)
```

Lunaris (use the `lunaris` branch's manifest):

```
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch lineage_ruan-bp4a-user
m bacon
```

LineageOS (use the `lineage-24.0` branch's manifest):

```
. build/envsetup.sh
breakfast ruan user
m bacon
```

crDroid (use the `crdroid` branch's manifest):

```
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch ruan user
```

## Notes

- The kernel is built from source (`kernel/xiaomi/sm7435`, Xiaomi's
  ruan-u-oss updated to the latest 5.10 LTS). Its ABI matches the stock
  OS3.0 vendor modules, which are shipped prebuilt. Set
  `RUAN_PREBUILT_KERNEL=true` to use the prebuilt Image instead.
- Vendor blobs come from HyperOS OS3.0.303.0.WFSMIXM (Global).
- Redmi Smart Pen and POCO Smart Pen work with pressure. See `pen/`.
- Kernel logs: /sys/fs/pstore stays empty (the bootloader clears that
  memory). `tools/ruan_lastlog.py` pulls the last panic from `rawdump` and
  the logs of previous boots from `oops` over adb (needs root).
